# DiscordCrasher
Just a dumb "malware" who's purpose is to crash Discord
# What Does it do?
Edits the discord index.js file adding a line that makes discord crash on startup
# Any persistance?
Yeah! It copies itself to the startup
# But why?
I don't know I was roaming the Discord folder to see if a file didn't have the hash-check and the main file didn't! so I took the opportunity to make a malware out of this
